## {attributes.title}

It's been a wild couple of months! At the start of June, I started my new job as a React/React Native developer at Anderson Trucking Service. They've been absolutely lovely to work with so far. I'm still in my 90-day probationary period, but they've been extremely understanding as I took time off to handle my . . .

Wedding! It's finally done! My partner of 10 years and I got married in a small ceremony in our backyard, officiated by my father. I will likely update this post with some pics once I get them from the photographer, and once I have those that will also kick off the process of sending cute Thank You cards.

I decided to take his name. I've been joking that I'm "being a bad feminist for the SEO". Totally worth it to just be able to buy "kimfreechack.com" (it's cheaper than the ".me" address!) and grab emails like "kim.freechack@proton.me". No numbers, no prefixes, pure bliss. Except for having to spell out my new name all the time (it's "chack" not "check"), fill out all this paperwork and rework my ugly lowercase cursive k's. 

At the end of July, we went to Final Fantasy XIV Fanfest in Las Vegas as our honeymoon! It was originally meant to be more of a large group thing since we play that game with a ton of people, but I'm the only person who made it through that online ticket queue, and I was only permitted to grab one other ticket. Nick and I had a wonderful time. We have now been at two expansion unveilings live: *Shadowbringers* and *Dawntrail*. It was, in spite of the lines and the heat and mismanagement on the part of the Las Vegas Convention Center staff, a good time.

We didn't have tickets to the Sunday concert, so we went to the Mob Museum and Container Park on those other days. Both were fantastic attractions (even though the adult slide was shut down because it was too hot) and I can't recommend them highly enough!

I woke up with fever and chills three days later. Sure enough, it was COVID<code>&#8212;</code>on paper my first infection, though I suspect I caught it extremely early in February 2020 before anyone had any recommendations, vaccines, or containment procedures. I didn't have to wonder long where I caught it. You can add me to [the infamous FanFest COVID furry's](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/15k3pgv/please_enjoy_some_schadenfreude_of_my_fanfest) body count. ðŸ’€

I'm apalled that his first thought when he showed symptoms that first day was to acquire DayQuil instead of, you know, staying inside and getting tested. I'm still quite baffled that he then *broadcast his sins for the whole internet to see in the form of a furry webcomic. And then doubled down when people started to roast his ass.* I could never be this selfish and would never find myself in this situation but *if I had* you could *never* get me to confess to this. You couldn't get this out of me at Guantanamo Bay. And here he is, offering it freely in an animated. Furry. Webcomic.

This fandom is the gift that keeps on giving (me diseases).

My husband continues to have the immune system of a god and never even tested positive. I'm extremely grateful that one of us was funcitonal during this time, though it was weird to be newly married and essentially quarantining from each other.

Even with the Paxlovid (which I qualified for because of my asthma), I was knocked out for like 5-6 workdays. I am<code>&#8212;</code>once again<code>&#8212;</code>extremely grateful to ATS for extending so much leeway around attendance to a new employee and for being an all-around happier place to work. Now that I'm feeling better, I'm hoping to knock things out of the park!
