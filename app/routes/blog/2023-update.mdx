I have had a lot of creative energy this year and most of it went nowhere. I feel like I'm on the cusp of truly feeling like a senior developer, but I'm still learning in private. I keep putting off the very important act of writing and talking about all the things I'm fired up about publicly.

This is at least in part [Sapper's](https://sapper.svelte.devhttps://sapper.svelte.dev) fault. It was deprecated shortly after I launched my blog and its successor, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) was . . . not ready to go yet. Three separate attempts over the course of a year to convert my blog to SvelteKit using the provided instructions went poorly. I didn't even write down the problems I ran into during each of the attempts I made, which seems like a real waste now! I got stuck in that classic web developer loop of tinkering with the blog instead of just _blogging_.

Originally I chose to build my website in Svelte because I wanted a break from all the React I was doing at work. React was a giant by that point, and I was rooting for the little guy who was not owned by ~~Facebook~~ Meta. However, now that my day-to-day work is in SwiftUI, I felt it was time to switch back to React and keep my skills fresh. And if I was going to switch back to React, why not try out the new<sup>1</sup> kids on the block, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix).

But I wasn't merely going to port things over. After looking at this thing for a year or two, I started to find it ugly. This time, I would build something [simpler and cleaner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4spBKeErkE), something that put writing first.

Authors like Stephen King and Margaret Atwood have the following advice for those who wish to be writers (paraphrased by me): in order to get good at writing, you have to write a lot. A lot of that writing will be garbage. Get it out, and don't be self-conscious about it.

Inspired by some other creator's "Digital Gardens", and decided to follow this approach. I spent several months attempting to cultivate a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) of my own with [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), and though I liked it for a while, the same thing happened there that always happens to me when I get too deep into any planning system &mdash; I got too bogged down in the checklists and the daily minutiae and I didn't spend time on the deep learning and reflection that I wanted to be prioritizing.

I've switched back to a simpler handwritten journal with reflective prompts. I haven't abandoned the idea of learning in public! Instead of paying Obsidian $20/month to host this "second brain", I've decided to just keep my notes, blog drafts, and other drabbles like that here.

1. I'm sure these aren't _that_ new, but they sure haven't been adopted by my corner(s) of corporate America yet.
