I'm obsessed, hence why I tipped the creator and am using it on this site and in all my IDEs. Hell, I like this font so much I've considered buying this hoodie.

I'm kind of over it. I still love the italic, but mostly as an accent like it's used on this website. The non-italic font is too skinny and nothing to write home about. I'm on the lookout for something rounder.
