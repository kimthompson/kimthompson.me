## MPR

Maintained American Public Media’s old web applications and built new ones, using everything from server-side Node and Rails to frontend React and SCSS. Performed code reviews, mentored new team members and set up automation and guardrails. Proposed new platforms and solutions to increase efficiency and reduce the chances for errors, even as our team continued to shrink. 
•	Built much of our reusable React component libraries and pushed for them to be open source and published on NPM.
•	Vetted new tools like Next.js, TypeScript, and React Native, devised the initial architecture of the apps that ended up using them, and trained the rest of my team how to work on them.
•	Reworked APM Reports to pass all of Google’s AMP rules so they would more frequently be the top result for the stories they broke. The day Curtis Flowers’ conviction was overturned APM Reports had a record 175K page views.
•	Proposed we move to Next.js when we had difficulty getting React and server-side rendering to play nicely. Created a demo that convinced my team that this would be more stable in the long run.
•	Created the initial version of YourClassical in React Native, proving that we could develop an audio-first app for iOS, Android, and web and presenting it to the Technology Division.
•	Proposed that we start tracking our tickets on our internal GitLab, which we were already paying for and requires basically no maintenance, instead of running our own Redmine server. This saved our Ops team up roughly 2-4 hours of support time per sprint.
•	Leveraged my journalism/dataviz background to work with the newsroom and revamp our election site. Created new maps and charts for the 2018 and 2020 elections.

## Design Center

Helped develop applications for iOS, web, and Windows. Hired as the firm’s first frontend developer, but quickly had to pivot to learning iOS and Windows development to fulfill the company’s engagements that materialized.
• Worked on a mix of midsize agile projects with a small team of developers and small solo projects.
• Managed client and project manager expectations, sometimes helping them find solutions they did not think to ask for.
• Wrote the company’s frontend web standards.
• Taught the designers how to write solid HTML and CSS markup, as well as how to use VS Code.
• Stressed to the owner that frontend development, particularly JavaScript development, cannot be offloaded onto designers with no relevant training.

## Ameriprise

Rotated between three different technical positions over the course of 18 months as part of a program for recent computer science graduates.
• Redesigned and wrote the front end for Ameriprise’s advisor compensation application homepage, working within the limits of the old JSP, IE-only application.
• Tested and polished a client-facing dashboard built with Backbone.js.
• Conducted working sessions to complete disaster recovery plans for all my department’s applications.
